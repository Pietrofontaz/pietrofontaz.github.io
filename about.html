  Hi, I'm a Shell and I'd like to think about myself as an artist. Maybe it's not who I am yet, but it's what I aspire to be.
</p>
<P>
  My journey starts in the countryside of a little town, Reggio Emilia, known worldwide because of the Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano Reggiano in italian) but not much more. I studied in my town until I finished highschool, then I studied Jazz Guitar in Bologna for 2 years before starting to study Applied Music in the Conservatory of Piacenza. There I met a lot of interesting teachers and people that built in me interest in a lot of different forms of art, and helped me in my personal artistic growth.
</p>
<p><b>Why the name Shell In A Forest?</b>
</p>
<p>Well, it comes from one of my experiences with the Conservatory; Piacenza is crossed by the river Po, wich flows into the Mediterranean Sea. We had different projects connected to it, and on one of our first trips over there I found some shells in a field, inside a grove and 250 kilometres far from the sea.
</p>
<p>And then I thought that everyone sometimes may feel like they are a Shell In A Forest, they feel out of place and don't belong where they are. <b>I felt like that a lot growing.</b> It was not because of the place where I live or because of the people I lived with, it was all about myself and my own path in this world, and I hope I'm making some steps in the right direction now, even if my road will end with me and I'll be the only one to know if it was or not the right one.
</p>
<p>Later I discovered they were a singular kind of creature that lives in sweet water, related to the sea ones, and totally common.
</p>
<p>My first form of expression right now is music, but I also love photography and poetry and I'm working with video and stuff lately; every article will contain the material used for any artwork and maybe (very unsure yet about that) what it means to me.
</p>
<p><b>Hope you enjoy my first website people, love you very much.</b>
